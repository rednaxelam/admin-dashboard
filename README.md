For this project (done as part of The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course), I needed to use the knowledge I'd gained about CSS grid to create a webpage following a design reference.

While I made the page somewhat responsive, I don't expect the page to work well on mobile or tablet devices (I haven't properly covered responsive and mobile webpage design yet). The design reference can be viewed in the root folder above and the webpage can be viewed via the following link: https://rednaxelam.github.io/admin-dashboard/.
